There are 3 steps involved when using a function. 1. Declare your function.
Officially, that is what the line: #include <math.h>
is for. #include performs "textual substitution". When the compiler chews up 
your program, it replaces that one line with the contents of that entire 
header file. In that header file is the declaration of sin( ), cos( ), pow( )
, sqrt( ) and many of other callable functions. You can see a lot of
available functions you can call in the book.
The declaration needs to be found before the compiler finds a call to that 
function. Very often, programmers put these function declarations at the very 
top of the file to ensure they are found before any executable statements that
could call that function.

2. Call your function.
Officially, I refer to the caller and the callee. These
are different parts of the code. The caller makes the request. 
The callee responds to the request. I also like to call the caller
"driver code" since it is often what gets the program moving along.
3. Implement the body of your function
You have to instruct the computer on what your function should do
when it is called. This is often the hardest part of all the 
three steps listed here.
In the case of these mathematical functions, #include <math.h> takes
care of steps 1 and 3. So all we have to do is proceed with step 2. 
Eventually, we will get around to making and calling functions 
we built ourselves.
